# Application of Predictive Analysis Spreadsheet on Easy Egg StartUp idea

This project is firmly rooted in a data-driven approach, centering around a loss management model designed to mitigate the inevitable egg production losses associated with the industry. Research findings indicate that egg production losses, spanning from production to commercialization, typically amount to around 30% of the total produced eggs. This stark reality implies that, on average, only 70% of eggs successfully make it to the shelf, succumbing to technical challenges such as breakages and stringent size requirements. Furthermore, additional losses arise from factors like limited shelf life and packaging breakages, resulting in a decline in overall value. To address these challenges and enhance the value proposition, a loss management solution becomes imperative. This solution aims to add value to egg breakages, meeting the demand in the market while concurrently minimizing the economic impact of losses in egg production.
