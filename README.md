# Empowering SMEs: A Cost-Effective Excel-Based Solution for Predictive Financial Analysis in Easy Egg Startup

The majority of predictive analysis tools come with a hefty price tag, making it challenging for SMEs to access the means to calculate their break-even points. Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) commence their operations without the benefit of comprehensive business projections derived from market data. In response to this, I have utilized an Excel spreadsheet to forecast the financials for my startup, Easy Egg. This pragmatic approach empowers SMEs, enabling them to leverage Excel tools and formulas to persuasively present their financial projections when seeking investments or loans from banks. The application of predictive analysis becomes pivotal for SMEs and entrepreneurs, facilitating well-informed decisions regarding the timeline for achieving profitability based on concrete numerical data rather than mere intuition.

This commitment to data-driven decision-making fosters a heightened level of professionalism in business operations and the establishment of realistic goals. Within this document,I will adeptly demonstrate the Excel spreadsheet's predictive analysis, showcasing its various components. Furthermore, I will articulate the startup idea through a comprehensive presentation of financials derived from the predictive analysis. This strategic use of predictive analysis serves as the linchpin in ensuring the success of the startup pitch, offering a tangible vision of the business's potential trajectory with the right support and opportunities.

## Application of Predictive Analysis Spreadsheet on Easy Egg StartUp idea

This project is firmly rooted in a data-driven approach, centering around a loss management model designed to mitigate the inevitable egg production losses associated with the industry. Research findings indicate that egg production losses, spanning from production to commercialization, typically amount to around 30% of the total produced eggs. This stark reality implies that, on average, only 70% of eggs successfully make it to the shelf, succumbing to technical challenges such as breakages and stringent size requirements. Furthermore, additional losses arise from factors like limited shelf life and packaging breakages, resulting in a decline in overall value. To address these challenges and enhance the value proposition, a loss management solution becomes imperative. This solution aims to add value to egg breakages, meeting the demand in the market while concurrently minimizing the economic impact of losses in egg production.

### Summary
The foundation of our startup idea is fortified by comprehensive data analysis and financial figures, providing prospective investors with a clear view of the anticipated financial cash flows. As we introduce a novel product to the market, this necessitates thorough financial projections to serve as invaluable insights for strategic decision-making. Easy Egg, our venture, is set to bring forth a product that is unprecedented on Zimbabwean shelves. Our distinguishing strength lies in our fearless approach to innovation, and our unwavering commitment to delivering the highest quality product in the market. Beyond catering to local demand, our vision extends to becoming a formidable player in the Continental market. At the core of Easy Egg's mission is the promotion of health among our customers, a paramount concern for every citizen. This commitment forms the bedrock of our existence and paves the way for our success. Furthermore, we address the challenges faced by egg producers through a robust loss management strategy. By adding value to egg breakages, surplus eggs with low demand, and smaller eggs, we transform them into high-demand products. This approach serves as a market strength and positions us to forge partnerships with poultry egg producers, creating a mutually beneficial value addition strategy. Our goal is not only to provide a groundbreaking product but to revolutionize the market and establish enduring partnerships within the industry.

#### a. Geotargeting

The capital city Harare enbodies two of the largest egg producing companies in Zimbabwe and the largest SME egg producers in Zimbabwe. Therefore the startup initial location is favourable in Harare. In future we would like to expand to most parts of the province inorder to cover all SME egg producers. Our major expansion target over the years is to join the regional and continental export market

**Service Comparison of liquid Egg and Conventional egg**
**Size/Package:** Liquid egg sizing is a weight on weight comparison to the conventional egg.
**Price Model:** The conventional egg price is based on the grading which translates to a model based on weight or grade. Liquid Egg price is based on content irregardless of grade or size of the egg.
**Customer Needs:** The conventional egg provides all customers with a combination of the yolk and the egg white irrespective of the customer intended use of the egg. Liquid Eggs provide content specifically towards the need of the customer. If the customer wants 80% yolk of the egg content per litre that’s what liquid egg will provide. Liquid egg provides the direct need of the customer.
**Storage:** The conventional egg can be stored easily on the shelf but limited shelf life. Depending on the need of the customer Liquid eggs come in various forms that is plain product, preserved liquid egg for more shelf life and powdered egg.

#### b. Risks

*   **Fluactuations:** Our results of operations and financial condition, as well as the selling prices for our products, are dependent upon the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials such as 
                       packaging, preservatives and eggs. 
*   **Partner Depended:** Our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans and/or markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest 
                         customers.
 *   **Risks involved in fully automated processes:** Our processes can be directly affected if any segment of the plant malfunctions. The process is cohesive and cascaded so that each process depends on the 
                                                      other.
